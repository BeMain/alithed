# Pyglet Survival Game

This project is mainly a way for me to get back into python, as well as to learn pyglet. If there ever comes a fully functioning game out of it, that is just a biproduct.

Feedback is very much appreciated! I'm in no way a professional programmer, and as I said, I do this for the learning experience.

Here is the project's Trello Board with planned features:
